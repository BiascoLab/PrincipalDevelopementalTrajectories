# Principal Developemental Trajectories Estimation

This is a R implementation of the  structure-aware algorithm aimed to at revealing and consolidating continuous, low-dimensional and high- density structures in the underlying higher-dimensional data, while ignoring noise and outliers. The theory, proof of convergence to the exact underlying data manifolds (under Gaussian noise assumption) and a deep investigation of its performance under different scenario can be found in Wu, Shihao, et al.
